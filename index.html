        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p class="lead">Hello everyone! My name is Allison Fain and I am a Girl Scout in troop 3006. For my Gold Award (the highest honor for a Girl Scout), I have decided to create 2 lending libraries that will go in Ocee Park. These will help serve the community from allowing mothers a break with a book while their child practices a sport, quieting siblings during a game or practice, and allowing walkers and elderly visitors a nice time in the park. These libraries will be filled with all sorts of genres and hope to serve a wide range of people. The rules are simple: if you take a book, you must substitute a book of your own. This will allow the library to remain full and the books to change, giving a unique experience each time (of course I factored in basic human error and will have extra books given to the faculty of Ocee Park).</p>

        <h4>Why this project?</h4>

        <p>In this day and age, being literate is a prerequisite for any job, evidenced by the 99.8% literacy rate from 2015 (knoema.com) compared to the world literacy rate of 86% (World Bank). For homeless people, they have been failed by the United States government and library system. The public libraries in the area of North Fulton, as well as across the United States, require that you have an address in order to have access to check out the books (afphs.org). This puts homeless people at a disadvantage and makes it incredibly hard for them to exercise their minds and enrich their vocabularies, thus making it harder to obtain a job and end the cycle of poverty. My lending libraries will combat this problem by providing a free library and making it available to anyone, as long as they replace it with a book or bring a book back. By making a network of libraries, the books can be intermixed and changed between the locations.

My target audience is anyone who uses the parks that I establish the libraries in, but with an emphasis on homeless people who cannot access libraries because they do not have an address. With the addition of the lending library network, such individuals will have the opportunity to read books, previously unavailable to them, which can broaden their vocabulary (which can prove useful in a job interview).
